# 🧠 Bubble Sort in C

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

**Time Complexity:**
- Worst Case: O(n²)
- Best Case: O(n) *(when the array is already sorted)*
