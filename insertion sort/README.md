# Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It builds the final sorted array one item at a time by comparing the current element to its predecessors and placing it in the correct position.

## Time Complexity

- **Worst Case:** O(n²)
- **Best Case:** O(n) (when the array is already sorted)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (in-place sorting)
