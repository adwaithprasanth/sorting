Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It uses the divide-and-conquer approach to divide the array into two halves, recursively sort them, and then merge them.

## 📊 Time Complexity

- **Worst Case:** O(n log n)
- **Best Case:** O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) (extra space required for merging)
